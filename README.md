GPTHEIST is a read-only Robinhood Chain launch desk plus a deterministic market-replay CLI inspired by the ten-agent operating system described by [@immortalhowwl](https://x.com/immortalhowwl). Every Pons factory launch crosses ten visible evidence stages. Palermo vetoes unsupported action; Professor never sends an order.

The live Desk reads public chain data only. It has **no wallet connection, private key, signing, brokerage integration, or order execution path**. Raw launch events do not prove liquidity, price quality, slippage, or social quality, so the live trade gate fails closed.

## Sixty seconds

Requires Node.js 18 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakemctigue/gptheist-live.git
cd gptheist-live
npm install
npm run desk
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. The Desk reads recent `TokenLaunched` events from the verified Pons v2 factory on Robinhood Chain (chain ID `4663`). Double-click an intercept to open its transaction on Blockscout.

For the fully offline deterministic replay instead:

```bash
npm run demo
```

The replay uses the bundled `fixtures/success.json`:

```text

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run desk` | Builds and opens the read-only live launch desk on port `4173` |
| `npm run demo` | Builds and runs the bundled safe replay |
| `node dist/src/cli.js replay fixtures/veto.json` | Replays any local fixture and writes an audit log |
| `node dist/src/cli.js agents` | Lists all ten roles and boundaries |
| `node dist/src/cli.js doctor` | Checks Node, fixture access, logs, dependencies, and execution mode |
| `npm test` | Builds and runs the complete test suite |

## Production deployment

The included `railway.json` builds the TypeScript project, starts the Desk on Railway's assigned `PORT`, and checks `/health`. Deploy the repository from the Railway dashboard or CLI after setting a production RPC endpoint:

```bash
railway variables set ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL="https://your-robinhood-chain-rpc.example"
railway up
```

`ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL` may contain a comma-separated fallback list. Append `#nologs` to an endpoint that supports ordinary reads but does not support `eth_getLogs`:

```text
https://read-rpc.example#nologs,https://archive-rpc.example
```

The live snapshot scans up to 25,000 recent blocks, so the production endpoint must support historical `eth_getLogs` requests. `RPC_URL` remains supported as a compatibility alias. With neither variable set, the app uses public Robinhood Chain endpoints suitable for local evaluation and light traffic.

After `npm link`, use the shorter binary form:

```bash
gptheist desk
gptheist demo
gptheist replay fixtures/veto.json
gptheist agents
gptheist doctor
```

## The handoff

```text
TOKYO → BERLIN → RIO → DENVER → LISBON
  → STOCKHOLM → NAIROBI → HELSINKI
  → PALERMO (PASS / VETO) → PROFESSOR
```

1. **Tokyo** frames the observation.
2. **Berlin** locks the criteria before analysis.
3. **Rio** checks technical context.
4. **Denver** grades the supplied social signal.
5. **Lisbon** validates data and handoffs.
6. **Stockholm** checks liquidity, slippage, and simulated size.
7. **Nairobi** compresses the cleared signals.
8. **Helsinki** prepares an append-only trace.
9. **Palermo** attempts to stop unsafe work.
10. **Professor** returns the final paper-only decision.

See [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md) for responsibilities and approval boundaries.

## Replay your own fixture

Copy a bundled fixture and edit its observation fields:

```bash
cp fixtures/success.json my-replay.json
npm run build
node dist/src/cli.js replay my-replay.json
```

Every replay input is local JSON; replay mode does not fetch market data. Fixtures are schema-validated before the first handoff, and terminal control characters are escaped. Identical input under the same policy version produces the same run ID, handoffs, timestamps, and final decision. Audit records are written to `runs/<run-id>.jsonl`. Existing records are immutable: the CLI refuses to overwrite a run ID with different content.

A run is vetoed when any configured boundary fails, including:

- incomplete or invalid replay data;
- momentum below `0.55`;
- social quality below `0.50` or fewer than `100` fixture samples;
- liquidity below `$1,000,000`;
- estimated slippage above `25 bps`;
- requested size outside its explicit cap;
- any supplied risk flag.

These thresholds are demonstration rules, not trading advice or validated predictors.

## What this is not

- not ten live LLM instances;
- not evidence that a historical trade happened;
- not a backtesting engine or profit calculator;
- not a wallet, exchange, broker, or execution system;
- not able to place, sign, route, or settle orders.

The Desk is connected only to public, read-only Robinhood Chain RPC endpoints. It verifies factory provenance and reads each launch's current Pons state at the same snapshot block. A deterministic score can place supported ETH launches on the **WATCH** list; unsupported pairs, unsafe taxes, completed/rescued curves, malformed evidence, and unavailable reads receive an explicit **VETO**. WATCH is observation only, never an order or promise of market quality.

It is an open, deterministic reference implementation of the **ownership → handoff → veto → final decision** pattern. Use it to inspect and extend the coordination logic before connecting any external system.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run build
npm pack --dry-run
```

The only direct runtime dependency is `viem`, used to ABI-encode and decode pinned read-only Multicall3 requests. CI tests Node 18 and Node 20, and dependency audits run before release.

## Safety

Never put secrets or private keys into fixtures. This project has no live execution path. Any future integration that can publish, spend, sign, delete, or move money must remain behind explicit human approval and should be reviewed independently.
